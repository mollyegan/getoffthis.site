      <span class="yearsVal"></span> years on earth. In <span class="yearsVal"></span> years, what could you have accomplished?
    </p>

    <p>
      They say you learn something new every day. Life could hold nothing but intrigue as it unfolds its inner workings to you. 
      You may grow in inches and in skill. There will be <span class="yearsVal"></span> years of knowing, of being-with, of remembering 
      birthdays and forgetting regrets. For some, <span class="yearsVal"></span> years is a lifetime, constructed in compositions 
      of sleep, talk, stepping, laughter, looking around and thinking backwards. Any interval of <span class="yearsVal"></span> 
      years on earth will do that to you: like it or not, you’re there.
    </p>

    <p>
      The average member of GenZ will spend about 18 years of life on a phone. 5 hours a day for the rest of a long-ish life multiples up to 109,500 hours. That’s 18 years of time, attention, care, boiled down to a black box of memory where all that can be shown for is obscurity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The constant stimulation provided by excessive screen use has rewired your brain. You take the task of focus and attention 
      to be an unachievable status. You move through the world with eyes glued and ears plugged. You see the stranger as shut off: 
      you resolve to log-on. The Real World has ceased to be stimulating. The World as you know it is mediated through tangles of 
      algorithmic programming and flashes of ordered numbers. Your faith is in what is on hand. <span class="yearsVal"></span> years, 
      and you have forgotten to think.
    </p>

    <p>
      The brain must have time for quiet. The brain must try relying on itself. The brain must be in a constant dialogue with its 
      living reality. And the brain must understand the severity of <span class="yearsVal"></span> years lost to artificial brightness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Life moves fast when you’re not looking. We urge you to look once again.
